## Integration with GUI Frameworks

These voice recognition libraries can be integrated with the GUI options researched earlier:

1. **PyWebview + Picovoice/Vosk**: Ideal combination for an offline voice app with modern UI
   - Python backend handles voice processing
   - Web frontend provides rich UI
   - Communication via PyWebview's JavaScript bridge
   
2. **CustomTkinter + SpeechRecognition**: Pure Python solution
   - Easy to implement
   - Good for quick prototyping
   - Limited UI customization compared to web technologies
   
3. **Electron + Whisper/Picovoice**: For complex applications
   - Leverage web technologies for UI
   - Use Python child process for voice processing
   - Communication via IPC or REST API

## Sample Integration Code (PyWebview + Picovoice)

Here's a simple example of how to integrate Picovoice with PyWebview:

```python
import webview
import os
import threading
from picovoice import Picovoice

class VoiceAPI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.is_listening = False
        self.pv = None
        self.thread = None
        self.last_intent = None
        self.access_key = "YOUR_PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY"  # Sign up at Picovoice Console
        
    def start_listening(self):
        """Start voice recognition"""
        if self.is_listening:
            return "Already listening"
            
        self.is_listening = True
        self.thread = threading.Thread(target=self._run_recognition)
        self.thread.daemon = True
        self.thread.start()
        return "Listening started"
    
    def stop_listening(self):
        """Stop voice recognition"""
        if not self.is_listening:
            return "Not listening"
            
        self.is_listening = False
        if self.pv:
            self.pv.delete()
            self.pv = None
        return "Listening stopped"
    
    def get_status(self):
        """Get current status"""
        return {
            "is_listening": self.is_listening,
            "last_intent": self.last_intent
        }
        
    def _wake_word_callback(self):
        """Called when wake word is detected"""
        print("Wake word detected!")
        # In real app, update UI via JavaScript
        
    def _inference_callback(self, inference):
        """Called when speech intent is recognized"""
        if inference.is_understood:
            self.last_intent = {
                "intent": inference.intent,
                "slots": inference.slots
            }
            print(f"Intent: {inference.intent}")
            print(f"Slots: {inference.slots}")
        else:
            self.last_intent = {"error": "Speech not understood"}
            
    def _run_recognition(self):
        """Run voice recognition in a loop"""
        try:
            # Initialize Picovoice
            self.pv = Picovoice(
                access_key=self.access_key,
                keyword_path="path/to/wake_word.ppn",  # Custom or use built-in
                wake_word_callback=self._wake_word_callback,
                context_path="path/to/voice_commands.rhn",  # Created in Picovoice Console
                inference_callback=self._inference_callback
            )
            
            # Process audio in chunks
            # In real app, use PyAudio or similar to get microphone input
            from pvrecorder import PvRecorder
            recorder = PvRecorder(device_index=-1, frame_length=self.pv.frame_length)
            recorder.start()
            
            while self.is_listening:
                pcm = recorder.read()
                self.pv.process(pcm)
                
            recorder.stop()
                
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in voice recognition: {e}")
            self.is_listening = False
```

## Summary

For a voices app with modern UI, combining **PyWebview** with **Picovoice** or **Vosk** offers the best balance of:

1. **Privacy** - Keep voice data on the device
2. **Performance** - Lower resource usage than cloud solutions
3. **UI Quality** - Modern web-based interface
4. **Development Experience** - Use Python for backend, web tech for frontend

If your app needs more general speech-to-text rather than command recognition, **Whisper** provides excellent accuracy but requires more resources.

## Action Items

1. **Get started with Picovoice**:
   - Sign up for free access key at [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/)
   - Install with: `pip install picovoice`
   - Create voice commands in Picovoice Console

2. **Integrate with PyWebview** using the example code above

3. **Consider fallback options**:
   - For general transcription: Whisper or SpeechRecognition
   - For lower-resource devices: Vosk
