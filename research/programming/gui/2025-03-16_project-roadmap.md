# Voices App Project Roadmap
Date: 2025-03-16

## Project Overview

The Voices App will be a voice recognition application with a modern, attractive UI. Based on our research, we've determined the optimal tech stack and development approach.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend (UI)
- **Framework**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript via PyWebview
- **Benefits**: 
  - Modern, customizable UI
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Smaller file size than Electron

### Backend (Voice Processing)
- **Framework**: Python
- **Voice Recognition**: Picovoice (offline voice AI platform)
- **Benefits**:
  - 100% offline processing (privacy-focused)
  - Low resource usage
  - Customizable voice commands

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Setup & Basic UI (Week 1)
1. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pywebview pywin32 picovoice pvrecorder
   ```
2. Create project structure:
   ```
   voices-app/
   ├── app/
   │   ├── static/
   │   │   ├── css/
   │   │   ├── js/
   │   │   └── img/
   │   └── index.html
   ├── voice_processing/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   └── recognizer.py
   └── main.py
   ```
3. Create basic UI with start/stop listening buttons

### Phase 2: Voice Recognition Integration (Week 2)
1. Sign up for Picovoice access key
2. Implement basic voice recognition
3. Connect recognition to UI via PyWebview's JavaScript bridge
4. Test with simple voice commands

### Phase 3: Core Functionality (Weeks 3-4)
1. Define and implement specific voice commands
2. Create custom voice models in Picovoice Console
3. Add visualization of voice input
4. Implement settings for sensitivity, etc.

### Phase 4: Finalization & Distribution (Week 5)
1. Polish UI and fix bugs
2. Package app for distribution:
   ```
   pip install pyinstaller
   pyinstaller --windowed --name VoicesApp main.py
   ```
3. Test on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
